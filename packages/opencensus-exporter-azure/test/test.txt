You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton.
Oh my God, this is super weird.
When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.
Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen.
And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me.
Thank goodness none of that was true.
Including the herpes. 
Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture!
Can't you understand that? No, you can't.
You're too young.
Ryan... has never made a sale.
And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita.
And everybody thinks he's a tease.
Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you.
[walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!
Do I have a special someone?
Uh well, yeah of course. 
A bunch of 'em. My employees.
If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people?
I'd pick them every time.
Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning. 
This is a little character I like to do [places a green turban with a yellow feather on his head], it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters.
[puts an envelope to his head] Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse.
[tears open envelope and pulls out card]
"Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin."
Here's the problem.
There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum.
It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.
Well, that was not at all what I expected.
Hoo hoo! Whoo.
My heart's still racing.
I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand.
All the time I was thinking, "I'm sleeping with your wife."
And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.
