# OpenCensus for Node.js
[![Gitter chat][gitter-image]][gitter-url]

OpenCensus Node.js is an implementation of OpenCensus, a toolkit for collecting application performance and behavior monitoring data.

The library is in alpha stage and the API is subject to change.

Please join [gitter](https://gitter.im/census-instrumentation/Lobby) for help or feedback on this project.

## Installation

Install OpenCensus with:

```bash
npm install @opencensus/nodejs
```

## Traces

### Instrumenting an Application

OpenCensus for Node.js has automatic instrumentation out of the box for those modules:

- [HTTP](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-instrumentation-http/README.md)
- [HTTPS](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-instrumentation-https/README.md)
- [HTTP2](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-instrumentation-http2/README.md)
- [GRPC](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-instrumentation-grpc/README.md)
- [IORedis](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-instrumentation-ioredis/README.md)
- [Redis](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-instrumentation-redis/README.md)

This means that spans are automatically created for operations of those packages. To use it, simply start the tracing instance.

```javascript
const tracing = require('@opencensus/nodejs');
tracing.start();
```

Similarly for Typescript:

```typescript
import * as tracing from '@opencensus/nodejs';
tracing.start();
```

### Manually Instrument an Application

In addition to automatic tracing, it is possible to manually create your own root and child spans.

```typescript
const rootSpanOptions = { name: 'your root span' };
tracing.tracer.startRootSpan(rootSpanOptions, (rootSpan) => {

    // You can create as many child spans as needed
    childSpan = tracing.tracer.startChildSpan({ name: 'name of your child span' });
    // Do some operation...
    // Finish the child span at the end of it's operation
    childSpan.end();

    // Finish the root span at the end of the operation
    rootSpan.end();
});
```

### Tracing Options

Tracing has many options available to choose from. At `tracing.start()`, you can set the following:

| Options | Type | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| [`bufferSize`](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-core/src/trace/config/types.ts#L25) | `number` | The number of traces to be collected before exporting to a backend |
| [`bufferTimeout`](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-core/src/trace/config/types.ts#L27) | `number` | Maximum time to wait before exporting to a backend |
| [`logger`](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-core/src/trace/config/types.ts#L29) | `Logger` | A logger object |
| [`logLevel`](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-core/src/trace/config/types.ts#L47) | `number` | Level of logger - 0: disable, 1: error, 2: warn, 3: info, 4: debug |
| [`samplingRate`](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-core/src/trace/config/types.ts#L35) | `number` | Determines the span's sampling rate. Ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 |
| [`propagation`](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-core/src/trace/config/types.ts#L41) | `Propagation` | A propagation instance to use |
| [`maximumLabelValueSize`](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-core/src/trace/config/types.ts#L52) | `number` | The maximum number of characters reported on a label value |
| [`plugin`](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-core/src/trace/config/types.ts#L68) | `PluginNames` | A list of trace instrumentations plugins to load |
| [`exporter`](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-core/src/trace/config/types.ts#L70) | `Exporter` | An exporter object |

## Plugins

OpenCensus can collect tracing data automatically using plugins. Users can also create and use their own plugins. Currently, OpenCensus supports automatic tracing for:

- [HTTP](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-instrumentation-http/README.md)
- [HTTPS](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-instrumentation-https/README.md)

## Propagation

OpenCensus collects distributed tracing. It is able to do so by propagating span data through services. Currently, OpenCensus supports:

- [B3 Propagation](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-propagation-b3/README.md)
- [Stackdriver Propagation](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-propagation-stackdriver/README.md)

## Exporters

OpenCensus can export trace data to various backends. Currently, OpenCensus supports:

- [Stackdriver](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-exporter-stackdriver/README.md)
- [Zipkin](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-exporter-zipkin/README.md)
- [Z-Pages](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-exporter-zpages/README.md)
- [Jaeger](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/blob/master/packages/opencensus-exporter-jaeger/README.md)

If no exporter is registered in the tracing instance, as default, a console log exporter is used.
