# OpenCensus HTTPS Instrumentation for Node.js
[![Gitter chat][gitter-image]][gitter-url]

OpenCensus HTTPS Instrumentation allows the user to automatically collect trace data. This package is used by [OpenCensus Node.js](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-node/tree/master/packages/opencensus-nodejs) to instrument HTTPS for both servers and clients.

The library is in alpha stage and the API is subject to change.
